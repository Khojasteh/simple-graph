TSimpleGraph = class (TCustomControl)
=====================================
This control provides a canvas for displaying and drawing of [simple directed graphs](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/SimpleDirectedGraph.html).

The control can export and import graphs as DFM format. The graphs can also be exported as image files or printed directly on a printer.

The control keeps the graph nodes and edges as a collection of [TGraphObject](TGraphObject.md) instances.
